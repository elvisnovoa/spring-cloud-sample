= spring-cloud-sample

A collection of RESTful services tied together using Spring Cloud. 

This project is meant to serve as a showcase of Spring technologies like Boot, Cloud, Security, OAuth2 and Data Rest. 

Some features like Cloud and OAuth are disabled by default. To enable them, add the following https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-profiles.html[Spring profiles]:

. tomcat - configures the Discovery and Gateway apps to run on port 8080 and all others in port 8081.
. cloud-enabled - loads the CloudConfig class to configure the Eureka client.
. oauth2-enabled - loads security config classes with jdbc token store.  

[NOTE]
For simplicity, these applications use embedded hsqldb datasources. For this reason, oauth2 security will NOT work unless 
a different database connection is configured (ie. Hsqldb Server, Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server).

You may run these applications in one of two ways: 

. Run each application using the embedded tomcat server.
. Deploy the wars into two tomcat instances. One running the Gateway and Discovery apps, and the second running the other microservices.

IMPORTANT: Please note that the Tomcat ports *MUST* match the ports on each application's `application.yml` file.

== Prerequisites 

*Java 8* - Some components use Java 8 features like LocalDate and lambdas.

*Lombok* - To run this code from eclipse, you'll need to install https://projectlombok.org/[Lombok].  

*Tomcat* - If you prefer not to use the embedded Tomcat, you will need to download https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi[Tomcat] 
and run two separate instances. One on port 8080 and another on port 8081.

== Discovery Service

Eureka Server with a dashboard to view registered clients. The dashboard UI is a copy of the original Spring dashboard with 
minor CSS customizations.

http://localhost:8081/discovery

== Gateway Service

To access services through the gateway, you must specify the service name and the URI (including root context path) 
in the form http://hostname:port/{gateway-context}/{service-id}/{service-context}/{resource-uri} 

For example, to call /uaa/oauth/token through the gateway, the url would be +
http://localhost:8080/api/uaa-service/uaa/oauth/token?grant_type=password&username=elvis&password=password

== Oauth2 Service

Simple implementation of an Oauth2 server using Spring Security Oauth2 and JDBC token store using HSQLDB. 

Usage: +
```ruby 
curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Basic ZWx2aXM6bm92b2E='  'http://localhost:8082/uaa/oauth/token?grant_type=password&username=elvis&password=password'
```

Where client id is 'elvis' and client secret is 'novoa'.

== Frontend Customer Service

Provides access to CRUD operations for a Customer entity on a database using Spring Data Rest.

Usage: +
*Get Customer list* +
```ruby
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8083/frontend-customers/customers/'
``` 
*Add Customer* +
```ruby
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 
-d '{ 
   "firstName": "Frodo", 
   "lastName": "Baggins", 
   "dateOfBirth": "2016-03-29" 
}' 'http://localhost:8083/frontend-customers/customers'
```

== Backend Account Service

A single RESTController serving random accounts. Showcases the use of custom Media Types to handle API versions
and Springfox Swagger to document the service endpoints. In reality, this could be a wrapper of another service in
the backend (ie. mainframe, middleware, appliance, etc).

Disclaimer regarding API versioning: this is merely one way to do it and by no means "the right way" to do so. I try to avoid using /v1/ 
in the URI to separate resource identification and representation, but that's entirely a personal preference.

Swagger UI:
http://localhost:8084/backend-accounts/documentation/swagger-ui.html

Usage:
```ruby
curl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/vnd.sample.account.v1+json' 'http://localhost:8084/backend-accounts/'
```

== Composite Service

Orchestration layer service that calls the Customers and Accounts services using the Discovery service and client-side load balancing.  

Usage:
```ruby
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
    "id":1,
    "includeAccounts":true
}' 'http://localhost:8085/composite/loadCustomer'
```
